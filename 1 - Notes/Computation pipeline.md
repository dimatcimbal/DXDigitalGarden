This is a single-stage pipeline devoted to general purpose computation. As the description says it consists of the only stage [Compute Shader stage](Compute%20Shader%20stage.md)

Several features have been provided to the compute shader that facilitate a flexible processing environment for implementing more general algorithms.

* Structured threading model 
* Group shared memory block
* Random read/write access
